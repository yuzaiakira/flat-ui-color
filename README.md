# Flat UI Color
flatuicolors.com website always amazed me until 3 years ago I made a small version of this site for myself.
Today, I saw this project in my system and said that I should come and open-source this project. :)

Note that I didn't know JS at that time and I started coding this site only by reading online documents, so it is clear that I have to optimize the JS codes of this site later. 😂🤦‍♂️

## TODO
- [ ] fix menu bug 
- [ ] optimize js codes
